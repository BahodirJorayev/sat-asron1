    passage: 'Botanists long believed that desert succulents absorb moisture exclusively through extensive shallow root systems that rapidly take up sporadic rainfall. _______ recent isotopic analysis reveals that certain species of Chilean columnar cacti obtain up to 60% of their annual water volume by capturing coastal fog directly through specialized epidermal trichomes.',

    passage: 'Ecologist Linda Vance examined the symbiotic interactions between acacia ants (Pseudomyrmex ferruginea) and swollen-thorn acacia trees. Trees colonized by ant colonies exhibited 85% less defoliation from herbivorous insects and grew twice as fast as uncolonized saplings. However, in an experiment where all competing vegetative overgrowth was manually trimmed away by researchers for two years, trees without ant colonies matched the growth rates of colonized trees.',
    questionText: 'Which finding, if true, would most logically explain Vance’s experimental observation?',
    options: {
      A: 'Swollen-thorn acacia trees do not produce nectar when uncolonized by ants.',
      B: 'Acacia ants protect the trees not only by deterring herbivores but also by aggressively pruning encroaching competitor plants that cast shade.',
      C: 'Herbivorous insects avoid acacia trees in environments where temperatures exceed 35°C.',
      D: 'The ant colonies migrate to neighboring tree species when sunlight is plentiful.'
    },
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: 'If ants prevent shading by clearing competitor vegetation, then when researchers manually trim that vegetation, uncolonized trees can grow just as fast because their light competition has been removed.'

    correctAnswer: '9',
    explanation: 'For a system of two linear equations to have infinitely many solutions, the two equations must be scalar multiples of each other. Multiplying the first equation $3x - 4y = 14$ by $3$ yields $9x - 12y = 42$. Comparing coefficients with $kx - 12y = 42$ reveals $k = 9$.'

    },
    correctAnswer: 'B',

    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: 'From equation 2, $y = 5x - 5$. Substitute into equation 1: $2x + 3(5x - 5) = 19 \\implies 2x + 15x - 15 = 19 \\implies 17x = 34 \\implies x = 2$. Then $y = 5(2) - 5 = 5$. Thus $x + y = 2 + 5 = 7$.'

    correctAnswer: '4',
    explanation: '$\\sqrt{x^5} = x^{\\frac{5}{2}}$. Thus $x^{\\frac{5}{2}} \\cdot x^{\\frac{3}{2}} = x^{\\frac{5+3}{2}} = x^{\\frac{8}{2}} = x^4$. So $p = 4$.'
